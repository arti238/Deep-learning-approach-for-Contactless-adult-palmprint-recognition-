# Deep-learning-approach-for-Contactless-adult-palmprint-recognition-
Recognition of individuals especially using palmprints  has received more attention nowadays.There are several advantages that make the palmprint authentication more appropriate for real-world applications: (i) low-cost image acquisition devices; (ii) applicability on both low and high-resolution images; (iii) discriminative features including ridges and creases; (iv) wide region of interest; (v) unique and reliable properties; (vi) hardly affected by age; and (vii) the high user acceptance of palmprint. IIT Delhi contactless dataset was used for this approach. The work is divided into three modules: Region of extraction, feature extraction, matching module. For RoI extraction CNN transfer learning approach was used here. Further, Extracted ROI were used as input for while training model for feature extraction. Palmprint matching was performed by using SVM, RF, KNN classifiers.
